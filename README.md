# Patient Appointment Management System

This is a web application designed to manage patient appointments. 
It allows for the management of patient data,marking presence, and adding patients manually through a simple interface. 
It utilizes Flask for backend functionality, SQLAlchemy for database management, and a custom HTML/CSS front-end for user interaction.

## Features

- **Patient Management**: Add, view, and update patient appointments.
- **Presence Tracking**: Mark whether a patient has attended their appointment.
- **Manual Entry**: Add patients manually through the user interface.
- **Real-time Editing**: Modify patient information directly in the table.

## Requirements

Before running the application, you need to install the necessary dependencies. Use the following command to install them:

```bash
pip install Flask flask_sqlalchemy
```

 **Database**: This project uses SQLite, and the `patients.db` database is created automatically when you run the application for the first time.
